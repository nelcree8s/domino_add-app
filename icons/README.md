# PWA icons

Add these files for "Add to Home Screen" to show your app icon:

- **icon-192.png** — 192×192 px
- **icon-512.png** — 512×512 px

Generate them from a square image (e.g. a domino or your logo):

- [PWA Asset Generator](https://github.com/elegantapp/pwa-asset-generator) (npm)
- [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) (upload one image, download pack)
- Any image editor: resize to 192 and 512, export as PNG

Use your app’s primary color (#5f7dff) or a domino graphic so the home screen icon is recognizable.
